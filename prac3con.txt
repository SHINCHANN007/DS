q1


Conclusion: Since the p-value (0.63590.63590.6359) is greater than the significance level 
(0.050.050.05) and the confidence interval includes 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There 
is no significant difference in the variances of the two populations.

q2

Conclusion: Since the p-value (0.4584) is greater than the significance level (0.05), and the 
confidence interval includes 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant 
difference in the variances of the two groups. 

------------------------

q3


Conclusion: Since the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), and the confidence 
interval does not includes 1, we reject the null hypothesis. The variances of the number of years 
spent in school by women in the UK and Germany are significantly different. 

------------------------

q4

Conclusion: Given that the p-value is 0.119, which is greater than the typical significance level 
of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that, based on this data, there is no 
significant evidence to suggest that the mean values of satisfaction index differ across the 
different levels of department .Thus, we conclude that the department does not have a significant 
effect on the variable satisfaction index.

q5

Conclusion: The two-way ANOVA analysis was conducted to assess the effects of department 
and experience level, as well as their interaction, on the satisfaction index.

The results revealed that the effect of department was not statistically significant 
(F=2.051,p=0.184F = 2.051, p = 0.184F=2.051,p=0.184), indicating no substantial differences in 
the satisfaction index across departments.  
Similarly, the effect of experience level was not statistically significant (F=1.572,p=0.241F = 
1.572, p = 0.241F=1.572,p=0.241), suggesting that the experience level (less than 5 years vs. 
greater than 5 years) does not have a significant impact on the satisfaction index.  
Furthermore, the interaction effect between department and experience level was also not 
statistically significant (F=0.781,p=0.487F = 0.781, p = 0.487F=0.781,p=0.487), implying that 
the relationship between department and satisfaction index does not vary based on experience 
level.  
Overall, the findings indicate that none of the factors or their interaction significantly influence 
the satisfaction index at the 0.05 level of significance.

q6

Conclusion: The two-way ANOVA results indicate that the level of education does not have a 
statistically significant effect on interest in politics (F=1.018,p=0.4341F = 1.018, p = 0.4341), 
and the interaction between education level and gender is also not statistically significant 
(F=0.066,p=0.8038F = 0.066, p = 0.8038).  
However, gender has a statistically significant effect on interest in politics (F=6.412,p=0.0351F 
= 6.412, p = 0.0351), suggesting that interest in politics differs significantly between genders.  
Overall, gender appears to be the only significant factor influencing interest in politics in this 
study.
