PRAC-2  Practical of Hypothesis testing.

Q1) Ten flower stems are chosen at random from a population and their heights are found to be (in cms) 63, 
63, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 71 and 71. Discuss whether the mean height of the population is 66 cms.

Q2) The class test is conducted for the 10 students and their marks are listed below: 50, 49, 52, 44, 45, 48, 
46, 45, 49, 45 Test if the average marks of the students can be taken to be 50. 

Q3) A random sample of 10 boys had the following IO’s  70, 120, 110, 101, 88, 83, 95, 88, 107, 100 Does 
this data support the claim that population mean IQ is 100?

Q4) Using the mtcars data set, test the hypothesis the average miles per gallon for care in this data set is 20 
mpg. 

Q5) Two types of drugs were used on 5 and 7 patients for reducing their weight. Drug A was imported and 
drug B indigenous. The decrease in the weight after using the drugs for six months was as follows: 

Q6) The sales data of an item in six shops before and after a special promotional campaign are as under:

Q7) Consider the survey data in the MASS library which represents the data from a survey conducted on 
students. Test the hypothesis whether the students smoking habit is independent of their exercise level at .05 
significance level. 

Q8) Consider the ‘cyl’ and ‘carb’ variables in ‘mtcars’ dataset and test whether it is dependent or not. 
Hypothesis: 

Q9) whether the choice of sport is independent of gender or not. So, we asked one hundred men and one 
hundred women which sport they prefer to play among archery, boxing, and cycling and summarizes the 
data obtained in the following two-way table. 

Q10) Is being left-handed hereditary? To answer this question, 250 adults are randomly selected and their 
handedness and their parents’ handedness are noted. The results are summarized in the table provided. Test,

Q11) The data is a contingency table containing 13 housetasks and their distribution in the couple: 
 rows are the different tasks 
 values are the frequencies of the tasks done: 
 by the wife only 
 alternatively 
 by the husband only 
 or jointly 
Check whether the household tasks are independent of Gender

PRAC-3  Practical Analysis of Variance

Q1. Two random samples were drawn from two normal population and their values are as 
follows 

Q2. Perform F-test for the give data. 
time_g1  time_g2  
Hypotheses: 
H0 : The variances of the two populations are equal. 
H1 : The variances of the two populations are not equal. 

Q3. A researcher studied education in the united kingdom and germany wanted to 
compare how many years of on average women in each country spent in school. 
The Researched obtained the random sample from both the countries. 
Test whether the average number of years spent in the school by women in 2 
countries are equal or not. 
H0 : The variances of the two populations are equal. 
H1 : The variances of the two populations are not equal. 


Q4. A large company is assessing the difference in ‘satisfaction index’ of employees in finance, 
marketing & client-servicing dept. Do the variance testing ( ANOVA) for the same. 
H0: The means of all groups are equal 
H1: The means of all groups are not equal

Q5. A large company is assessing the difference in ‘satisfaction index’ of employees in finance, 
marketing & client-servicing dept. Experience Level is also considered as one factor in study. 
(lt5 - less than 5,gt5 - greater than 5). Do the variance testing ( ANOVA) for the same  

Satindex  Dept  Experience    
75 FINANCE  lt5  
55 MARKETING  gt5
72 CS  lt5

H0: There is no significant difference in the mean satisfaction index across the departments 
(finance, marketing, client-servicing). 
H1: At least one department has a significantly different mean satisfaction index. 


Q6. In a research it was state that interest in politics was influence by the level of education and 
gender. Test the hypothesis(ANOVA) for given sample       
Gender  Education  Political_Int    
F  School  58
